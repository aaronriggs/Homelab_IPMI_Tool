After I made my post on Reddit for this project, I was given fantastic advice and assistance by members of r/homelab and r/learnpython. 

Thank you for the assistnace everyone. 



Application considerations for improvement:

u/trekxtrider - maintain state between full power loss events, using either my app or add to the bash script found at: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/mvmub3/a_way_to_silence_a_dell_server/


Application considerations for other manufacturers:  

u/LovesNatureMost - HPE iLO functionality - iLO4 is last manually controllable version 

u/w4drone - For discussing oracle X servers 


UI/UX improvements:

u/MXNPD - suggestion to add better descriptors for fan speed (percentage based vs rpm)

 

Packaging for release:

u/DamnFog - add installation instructions and consider .deb/rpm for packaging



Documentation suggestions:

u/DamnFog - add installation instructions   



Continued Python learning: 
u/jpgoldberg - Suggestion to continue learning the differences between class variables and instance variables (will help with multiple views in this app)
